# JavaFX MVC Tutorial

This repository contains a JavaFX project demonstrating the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. The project includes a sample application for managing a DVD collection using JavaFX.

## Project Structure

- **Model**: The `DVDCollection` class manages the data and business logic of the DVD collection.
- **View**: The `DVDCollectionAppView1` and `DVDCollectionAppView2` classes define the user interfaces for displaying DVD data.
- **Controller**: The `DVDCollectionApp1` class serves as the controller, handling user interactions and updating both the model and the view.

## Features

- **MVC Architecture**: Separates concerns into model, view, and controller components.
- **Dynamic View Switching**: Easily swap between different views using the MVC pattern.
- **Data Synchronization**: Ensures that user interactions are reflected across all relevant UI components.
- **Event Handling**: Demonstrates handling of user inputs such as adding and deleting DVDs.

## Getting Started

1. **Download and Setup**:
   - Download the `JavaFX_Model_View_Controller.zip` file from Brightspace.
   - Follow the installation instructions for JavaFX to ensure the code compiles and runs correctly.

2. **Run the Application**:
   - Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or any of your favourite text editor.
   - Run the `DVDCollectionApp1` class to start the application.
